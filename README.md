# Landing Page Project
Second project in Udacity course.

## Table of Contents
It's a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.
Additional tasks:
- Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
- Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
- Add a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
